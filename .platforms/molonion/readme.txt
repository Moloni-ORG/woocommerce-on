== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a paid version of the plugin? =
No. The plugin was developed and is made available completely free.

= How much will I have to pay for support? =
Like the Moloni software, all support is completely free and provided entirely by our Moloni Customer Support team.

= I have questions or suggestions, who can I contact? =
For any doubts or suggestions you can contact us via email suporte@moloni.pt.

= Documents are being issued without a taxpayer number =
By default, WooCommerce does not have a taxpayer/VAT field. Usually, you add another plugin that provides a taxpayer/VAT number field for the customer.

These plugins create a `custom_field` associated with the customer's billing address, such as `_billing_vat`.

Once you have such a plugin installed, select in the Moloni plugin settings which `custom_field` corresponds to the customer's taxpayer/VAT number.

== Installation ==
This plugin can be installed via FTP or using the WordPress plugin installer.

= Via FTP =
1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/moloni-on` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` option visible in WordPress
