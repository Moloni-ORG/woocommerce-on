No. The plugin was developed and is made available completely free.

= How much will I have to pay for support? =

= I have questions or suggestions, who can I contact? =
For any doubts or suggestions you can contact us via email soporte@moloni.es.

= Documents are being issued without a taxpayer number=
By default, WooCommerce does not have a taxpayer field, so what you usually do is add a plugin to add the taxpayer to the customer.

These plugins create a custom_field associated with the customer's billing address, such as `_billing_vat`.

Once you have a plugin for the contributor installed, select in the settings of the Moloni plugin which `custom_field` corresponds to the client's contributor.
